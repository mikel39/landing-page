              Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains
              in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th
              century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated
              dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar,
              intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and
              panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.

              The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the
              city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the
              largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest
              standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age.

              The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in
              Egypt. Most were built as tombs for the pharaohs and their
              consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.
